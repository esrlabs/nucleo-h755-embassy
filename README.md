1. How to use a customized memory.x file?
2. How to upload a binary to the second core? Which address? Where to configure?
3. Project structure for dual core?
   - Main project
   - Core 0 project
   - Core 1 project
   - Shared project
4. Which build system do we use? Can we do everything with cargo or do we need something like cargo-make?
5. Start-up sequence for dual core
